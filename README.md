# Linear Regression Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of Linear Regression using Python. The Jupyter notebook `LINEAR_REGRESSION.ipynb` includes the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Contents

- `LINEAR_REGRESSION.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for Linear Regression.
- Sample dataset used for training and testing (if applicable).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn


## Description

This project demonstrates the following steps in implementing Linear Regression:

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and libraries.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for training.
3. **Model Training**: Using scikit-learn to train the Linear Regression model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics.
5. **Visualization**: Plotting the results for better understanding and insights.
